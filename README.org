#+title: CS 6110 Software Verification Project

Verify all the things!

* Synopsis

Class project to verify some software written in Rust.

* Description

We'll put stuff here once we've figured out what we're doing.

* Goals

 - Learn about the Creusot annotations
 - Build something and verify it with the annotations
 - Consider ways that the annotations could be improved

* Resources

 - [[https://github.com/model-checking/kani][Kani]] :: Model checker for Rust

   From the README: Kani is particularly useful for verifying unsafe code in
   Rust, where many of the language's usual guarantees are no longer checked by
   the compiler.

   Kani has a [[https://model-checking.github.io/kani/][tutorial]].
